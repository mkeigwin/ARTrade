# ARTrade
## Concept: 
ARTrade is a forum for contemporary art lovers looking for a safe place to express themselves and interact with other artist/users. ARTrade will bring general information about some of the most popular International fine art fairs and allow users to engage with other users/attendees during these events. 

## Technologies:
React
Javascript
Node.js
PSQL
Socket.io

## User Story
Users have to create an account with ARTrade in order to enter the site. Once logged in, they are able to access their account profile based on the type of account they created. Artists will have a different account than consumers. Artist/Galleries have an option to post their art for sale or trade, post updates about their events and showings and join the global conversation! Users will be able to see this information, purchase art or choose events they want to assist to and add them to their saved events calendar.
